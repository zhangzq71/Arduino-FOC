# <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> minimal code

For those willing to experiment and to modify the code I suggest using the [minimal version](https://github.com/askuric/Arduino-FOC/tree/minimal) of the code. 
 > This code is completely indepenedet and you can run it as any other Arduino Schetch without the need for any libraries. 

## Github webiste downlaod
- Go to [minimal branch](https://github.com/askuric/Arduino-FOC/tree/minimal) 
- Downlaod the code by clicking on the `Clone or Download > Download ZIP`.
- Unzip it and open the schetch in Arduino IDE. 

## Using terminal
- Open the terminal:
  ```sh
  cd *to you desired directory*
  git clone -b minimal https://github.com/askuric/Arduino-FOC.git
  ```
- Then you just open it with the Arduino IDE and run it.
